# Build your own custom filed in Laravel Nova using Reactjs
This is a boilerplate for building custom field in Laravel Nova using Reactjs. 

The front end of Laravel Nova using Vuejs, which sometimes you may find its very hard to build your own custom if you don't know or have experience with Vuejs. 

So just thinking Vue can expose the DOM via ref directive, and we will attached  the  React component to it. Our React component will acting as a library that the correspond Vue component can consume.

Problem soldved!
